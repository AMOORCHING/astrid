# Product Requirements Document: Critical Security & Architecture Fixes

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD addresses the most critical security vulnerabilities and architectural anti-patterns identified in the codebase review. These issues represent immediate risks that could compromise system security, stability, and performance. This PRD covers fixing insecure parsing, async/await misuse, production security hardening, and resource management issues.

The goal is to eliminate critical vulnerabilities and architectural flaws that prevent the system from operating safely and efficiently in production environments.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Security Vulnerabilities**: Remove parser exploitation risks and production security exposures that could lead to DoS or RCE attacks.
2. **Fix Performance Anti-patterns**: Resolve async/await misuse that blocks Celery workers and prevents horizontal scaling.
3. **Harden Production Environment**: Secure Docker images and Kubernetes deployments against common attack vectors.
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect API endpoints from abuse and resource exhaustion attacks.
5. **Establish Resource Management**: Define proper Kubernetes resource constraints for predictable performance.

## User Stories

1. **As a security engineer**, I want the system to safely parse untrusted repository files so that malicious repositories cannot crash or compromise the analysis service.

2. **As a platform operator**, I want the production Docker images to exclude build tools so that the attack surface is minimized and container security is improved.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want Celery workers to process tasks efficiently so that the system can handle concurrent analysis requests without blocking.

4. **As a service maintainer**, I want API rate limiting in place so that the service remains available for legitimate users even under attack or abuse.

5. **As a Kubernetes operator**, I want pods to have proper resource definitions so that cluster scheduling is predictable and resource allocation is efficient.

## Functional Requirements

### Parser Security Hardening
1. The system must implement file size limits (max 10MB) for all parsed files to prevent memory exhaustion attacks.
2. The system must implement parsing timeouts (max 30 seconds) to prevent infinite loops and ReDoS attacks.
3. The system must validate XML structure before parsing `pom.xml` files using a secure XML parser with entity expansion disabled.
4. The system must sanitize and validate all regex patterns used in dependency parsing to prevent catastrophic backtracking.
5. The system must implement error boundaries that catch parsing exceptions and return safe error responses.

### Production Docker Security
6. The production Docker image must use multi-stage builds to exclude `gcc`, `build-essential`, and other build-time dependencies from the final image.
7. The final production image must run as a non-root user with UID/GID 10001.
8. The Docker image must use a minimal base image (`python:3.11-slim` or `distroless`) to reduce attack surface.
9. The system must implement `.dockerignore` to exclude development files and sensitive information from the build context.

### Async Architecture Correction
10. The Celery task `analyze_repository_task` must be refactored to use synchronous code patterns instead of `asyncio.run()`.
11. HTTP requests within Celery tasks must use the synchronous `requests` library instead of async `httpx`.
12. The system must maintain async patterns only in FastAPI route handlers where they provide performance benefits.
13. The system must implement proper error handling for network I/O operations in Celery tasks.

### API Rate Limiting
14. The `/analyze` endpoint must implement rate limiting of 10 requests per minute per IP address.
15. The system must implement global rate limiting of 100 concurrent analysis jobs to prevent resource exhaustion.
16. The system must return appropriate HTTP 429 responses with `Retry-After` headers when rate limits are exceeded.
17. The system must provide authenticated users with higher rate limits (50 requests per minute) when authentication is available.

### Kubernetes Resource Management
18. All Kubernetes deployments must define CPU requests (100m) and limits (500m) for predictable scheduling.
19. All Kubernetes deployments must define memory requests (128Mi) and limits (512Mi) to prevent node exhaustion.
20. The system must implement liveness and readiness probes for all services to enable proper health checking.
21. Kubernetes deployments must specify resource Quality of Service class as "Guaranteed" or "Burstable" instead of "BestEffort".

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Implementation of advanced authentication systems (future PRD)
- Complete rewrite of dependency parsing logic (separate refactoring PRD)
- Implementation of distributed tracing or advanced monitoring (operational PRD)
- Database security hardening (not applicable to current architecture)
- Advanced rate limiting with Redis backend (can use in-memory for MVP)

## Technical Considerations

- Use `slowapi` library for FastAPI rate limiting implementation
- Consider `defusedxml` library for secure XML parsing
- Implement file size checks before reading entire file content into memory
- Use `timeout-decorator` or similar for parsing operation timeouts
- Celery tasks should use connection pooling for HTTP requests to improve efficiency
- Resource limits should be based on actual usage patterns observed in development

## Success Metrics

1. **Security**: Zero successful parser exploitation attempts in penetration testing
2. **Performance**: Celery worker throughput increases by >200% after async corrections
3. **Stability**: Pod eviction rate reduces to <1% after resource limit implementation
4. **Availability**: API remains responsive under 2x normal load with rate limiting active
5. **Security Posture**: Docker image vulnerability scan shows <5 high/critical issues

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting Storage**: Should we implement in-memory rate limiting or use Redis for persistence across pod restarts?
2. **Parser Fallbacks**: When secure parsing fails, should we skip the file or attempt alternative parsing methods?
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Should we implement metrics collection for resource usage to tune limits over time?
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Should these changes be deployed incrementally or as a single coordinated release?
