# Product Requirements Document: Caponier MVP - GitHub Repository Security Analysis Platform

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for building the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of Caponier, a real-time security analysis platform for GitHub repositories. The MVP serves as the foundation for the broader Caponier security intelligence platform and must be completed within a 10-day sprint (August 11-21, 2025) to enable launch by August 25.

The MVP will allow users to input any public GitHub repository URL and receive a comprehensive security analysis including vulnerability detection, security scoring, and detailed reporting. This represents the core value proposition that will drive initial user adoption and GitHub stars.

## Goals

1. **Validate Core Value Proposition**: Demonstrate that automated security analysis of GitHub repositories provides immediate value to developers and security engineers.

2. **Establish Technical Foundation**: Build the core FastAPI-based analysis engine that can be extended with advanced features in future iterations.

3. **Enable Growth Metrics**: Create a shareable, viral-ready analysis experience that encourages users to analyze multiple repositories and share results.

4. **Prove Async Architecture**: Implement job queue processing that can scale to handle concurrent analysis requests without blocking the user interface.

5. **Generate Initial Traction**: Provide sufficient functionality to achieve 25+ GitHub stars and 100+ unique users within the first week of launch.

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to paste any GitHub repository URL and get a security analysis so that I can quickly assess the security posture of dependencies or projects I'm considering.

2. **As a security engineer**, I want to see detailed vulnerability information with CVE links so that I can understand specific risks and prioritize remediation efforts.

3. **As a project maintainer**, I want to get a security score for my repository so that I can understand how secure my project appears to users and what improvements would have the most impact.

4. **As a developer evaluating tools**, I want to see real-time progress during analysis so that I understand the system is working and can estimate completion time.

5. **As someone sharing security findings**, I want to save and share analysis results so that I can discuss security concerns with my team or community.

6. **As a security researcher**, I want to analyze repositories with critical and high-severity vulnerabilities only so that I can focus on the most important security issues without noise.

## Functional Requirements

### Repository Input and Validation
1. The system must accept any valid public GitHub repository URL in formats: `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `github.com/owner/repo`, or `owner/repo`.
2. The system must validate that the repository exists and is publicly accessible before starting analysis.
3. The system must handle invalid URLs gracefully with clear error messages.
4. The system must support repositories across all programming language ecosystems.

### Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis
5. The system must scan for vulnerabilities in direct dependencies using package manifest files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.).
6. The system must focus exclusively on High and Critical severity vulnerabilities to reduce noise and analysis time.
7. The system must integrate with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API to retrieve current CVE information.
8. The system must map discovered vulnerabilities to specific CVE identifiers with links to detailed descriptions.
9. The system must handle rate limiting from external APIs gracefully with appropriate retry logic.

### Security Scoring Algorithm
10. The system must calculate a weighted security score (0-100 scale) based on vulnerability severity levels where Critical = 10 points, High = 5 points per vulnerability.
11. The system must include maintenance health indicators in scoring: last commit date, contributor activity, and issue response time.
12. The system must provide score breakdown showing how vulnerability count and maintenance factors contribute to the final score.
13. The system must include comparative context (e.g., "Better than 70% of similar repositories").

### Asynchronous Processing
14. The system must implement job queue processing using Redis/RQ or similar to handle analysis requests asynchronously.
15. The system must provide real-time progress updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events showing current analysis stage.
16. The system must handle analysis timeouts gracefully with meaningful error messages after 5 minutes maximum.
17. The system must allow multiple concurrent analysis jobs without blocking the web interface.

### User Interface and Experience
18. The system must provide a single-page web application with a clean, minimal interface focused on the URL input form.
19. The system must display real-time progress during analysis with specific status messages (e.g., "Scanning dependencies...", "Checking vulnerabilities...").
20. The system must present analysis results in a structured report format including overall score, vulnerability list, and recommendations.
21. The system must provide shareable URLs for completed analysis results that persist for at least 24 hours.
22. The system must include social sharing capabilities (Twitter, LinkedIn) with pre-populated text highlighting key findings.

### Results Display and Sharing
23. The system must display detailed vulnerability information including CVE ID, severity level, affected package, and description.
24. The system must provide direct links to CVE database entries for each identified vulnerability.
25. The system must include actionable recommendations such as "Update package X to version Y" or "Review security practices".
26. The system must generate shareable security badges/widgets that can be embedded in README files.
27. The system must provide export functionality for analysis results in JSON format for programmatic use.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Data Persistence**: No permanent storage of analysis results or user accounts (future iteration will add caching).
2. **Private Repository Support**: No authentication or access to private repositories.
3. **Transitive Dependency Analysis**: No scanning of indirect/nested dependencies in the MVP.
4. **Historical Analysis**: No tracking of security score changes over time.
5. **Custom Vulnerability Databases**: No integration with proprietary or enterprise vulnerability sources.
6. **Advanced Reporting**: No PDF reports, executive summaries, or compliance mapping.
7. **API Access**: No programmatic API endpoints for external integrations.
8. **User Registration**: No user accounts, saved searches, or personalization features.
9. **Bulk Analysis**: No batch processing of multiple repositories simultaneously.
10. **Performance Optimization**: No caching, CDN, or advanced performance tuning.

## Design Considerations

### User Interface Design
- Use a clean, modern design similar to successful developer tools (GitHub, Vercel, etc.)
- Implement responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile devices
- Use clear visual hierarchy with the URL input form as the primary call-to-action
- Display progress with engaging animations and specific status messages
- Present results with clear visual indicators for severity levels (red for critical, orange for high)

### Technical Architecture
- Extend the existing FastAPI application structure already established in the project
- Use Redis for job queue management and temporary result storage
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time progress updates
- Design API endpoints to be RESTful and easily extensible for future features
- Use background workers (Celery/RQ) for analysis processing to keep the web interface responsive

### Performance Considerations
- Target analysis completion time of under 2 minutes for typical repositories
- Implement timeout handling to prevent infinite analysis jobs
- Use connection pooling for external API calls to improve throughput
- Design for horizontal scaling with stateless workers

## Technical Considerations

### External API Dependencies
- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: Primary source for CVE information with rate limiting considerations
- **GitHub API**: For repository metadata and file access (may require API token for higher rate limits)
- **Package Registry APIs**: npm, PyPI, RubyGems, etc. for dependency version checking

### Technology Stack Integration
- **FastAPI**: Extend existing application with new analysis endpoints
- **Redis**: Job queue management and temporary result caching
- **Celery/RQ**: Background task processing for analysis jobs
- **WebSockets**: Real-time progress updates to the frontend
- **React/Next.js**: Single-page application for the user interface

### Scalability Considerations
- Design worker processes to be stateless and horizontally scalable
- Implement circuit breakers for external API calls to handle service outages
- Use background job patterns that can be distributed across multiple worker nodes
- Plan for eventual transition to Kubernetes-based deployment

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Analysis Completion Rate**: 95%+ of valid repository URLs successfully complete analysis
2. **Analysis Speed**: 90% of analyses complete within 2 minutes
3. **User Engagement**: 50%+ of users analyze more than one repository in their session
4. **Sharing Rate**: 25%+ of completed analyses are shared via social media or direct links
5. **Error Handling**: Less than 5% of user sessions encounter unhandled errors

### Technical Performance Metrics
1. **API Response Time**: Analysis initiation endpoints respond within 500ms
2. **Concurrent Capacity**: System handles at least 10 concurrent analysis jobs
3. **External API Reliability**: Less than 1% of failures due to external service issues
4. **Progress Update Latency**: Real-time updates delivered within 2 seconds of status changes

### Growth and Adoption Metrics
1. **Initial Traction**: 100+ unique users within first week of launch
2. **Repository Coverage**: Analysis of 200+ unique repositories within first month
3. **Social Validation**: 25+ GitHub stars within first week
4. **Content Creation**: Analysis results shared on social media 50+ times

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Should we implement user-based rate limiting (e.g., 10 analyses per IP per hour) or rely on external API rate limits?

2. **Analysis Scope Optimization**: Should we implement smart dependency file detection to skip analysis of repositories without clear package manifests?

3. **Progress Granularity**: How detailed should real-time progress updates be? (e.g., per-package scanning vs. high-level stages)

4. **Error Recovery**: For partial analysis failures (e.g., some dependencies can't be checked), should we show partial results or require complete success?

5. **Caching Strategy for Future**: When implementing result caching, should we cache at the repository level, dependency level, or vulnerability level?

6. **Security Badge Design**: What visual design and data should be included in embeddable security badges for maximum adoption?
